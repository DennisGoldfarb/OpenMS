 <summary>Mass spectrometry (MS) software for Proteomics and Metabolomics</summary>
 <description>
  <p>
   OpenMS is a powerful set of tools as well as a C++ library to
   process low and high-resolution LC-MS(-MS) mass spectrometry data.
  </p>
  <p>
   OpenMS is modular, consisting of more than 80 chainable tools (executables).
   It features a graphical data viewer (TOPPView), a pipeline editor (TOPPAS) and
   wrappers for most tandem-MS search engines (like Mascot, MSGF+ and X!Tandem).
   The OpenMS library itself comes with Python bindings for rapid prototyping.

   <caption>TOPPView is a viewer for MS and HPLC-MS data supporting many common formats, e.g. mzML, mzData, mzXML and several others.
            The figure shows two instances of TOPPView displaying a HPLC-MS map and a MS raw spectrum.</caption>
